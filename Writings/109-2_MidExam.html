					In order to know anything, one's belief needs to be justified. But it is not clear what is the condition for a belief to be justified. For example, if John has studied for the test, hence remember the correct answer, we'd agree that he does know the answer. On the other hand, Tom did not study at all, he simply rolled his pencil to guess the answer, even if he guessed the correct answer, we would not agree that he knows the answer. 
					<p>
					Now consider the following case: Suppose that Tom has tried thousands of times and has confirmed that there is a 95% chance for him to get the correct answer if he rolls his pencil. When Tom gets the correct answer by rolling his pencil, does Tom really know the answer? Why?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					"Nobody knows what the things in the world are like really; we only know how they appear to us, not how they really are, what qualities they really have." Please comment on the previous statement.

		<h2>他心問題</h2>
		
		<div class="section">
			<ol class="num">
				<li>
				In which of the following cases does the "feeling" guarantee the truth of the statement about what is felt? Give your reasons.
					<ol class="lltd tight">
						<li>I feel anxious.</li>
						<li>I feel sick.</li>
						<li>I feel as if I'm about to be sick.</li>
						<li>I feel that I'm about to be sick.</li>
						<li>I feel able to do anything.</li>
						<li>I feel as if I have a frog in my throat.</li>
						<li>I feel that I have been deceived by my best friend.</li>
						<li>I feel that God exists.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
				Defend one of the following views:
					<ol class="lltd tight local">
						<li>That you can know that others have pains and can give evidence.</li>
						<li>That you can have well-founded belief that others have pains, but belief short of knowledge.</li>
						<li>That you do not have even well-founded belief in this matter.</li>

				Try to imagine being conscious but having no body. If you're able to imagine that, try to describe how is it possible. If you're not able to imagine it, is it because that consciousness without a body is impossible, in your opinion, or is it because that our powers of imagination are insufficient for the task?
				</li>
				<li>
				If someone you had conversed with many times died, and if his skull were posthumously opened-revealing not bones and tissue but plastic tubes and electric wiringwould this discovery lead you to believe or suspect that he had never been a conscious human being at all but a mindless automaton? Why or why not? (If someone opened your skull and found only plastic tubing and complicated circuits, would that person be entitled to say that you had been an automaton without conscious states all along?)

		<h2>語言如何有意義？</h2>
		
		<ol class="num">
			<li>
			Suppose that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in virtually all aspects, which we refer to as "Twin Earth". (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth.
			<p>
			The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of H2O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as "XYZ". The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as "English" call XYZ "water".
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called "water" were H2O and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now the question arises: when an Earthling and his twin on Twin Earth say 'water' do they mean the same thing?
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			In the book <i>Alice: Through the Looking Glass</i>, Alice encountered an egg-shaped creature named Humpty-Dumpty. During their conversation, Alice raised a question regarding the meaning of a word that Humpty-Dumpty has used. She thinks that Humpty-Dumpty has misunderstood the meaning of that word.
			<p>
			Humpty-Dumpty replied to Alice: "When I use a word, the word means what I choose it to mean, no more no less. If I use the word 'elephant' to mean a pencil, the word 'elephant' means a pencil rather than an elephant."
			</p>
			<p>
			Do you agree with Humpty-Dumpty? Please comment.
