				<li>Click the 'Choose files' button below and then navigate to the location where your old attendance reports are located.<br>By default, the attenance reports are saved to your <i>'Downloads'</i> directory but you can (and probably should) move them to a more permanent location.
				</li><li>The updated files will get saved once again to your <i>'Downloads'</i> directory.  <br> Browser security dictates that the files can only be written to that directory... I cannot automatically save them elsewhere.
				</li><li><b>NB</b> - you can update several files at once using the <i>&lt;shift&gt;</i> and/or <i>&lt;ctrl&gt;</i> keys to select multiple files (but you will likely have to click <i>'Allow'</i> in a system dialog before the updated reports are download).
